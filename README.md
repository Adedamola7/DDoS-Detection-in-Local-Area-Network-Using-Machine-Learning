# DDoS Detection Model

This repository contains a machine learning-based model and the dataset used for detecting Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in network traffic. The system is designed to monitor traffic patterns in real-time, classify malicious activity and help prevent service disruptions.

## Overview

Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are a significant threat to network stability and availability. This project implements a machine learning approach to analyze network traffic data, identify potential DDoS attacks and classify them for mitigation. The model is trained and evaluated using network dataset.

## Features

- DDoS detection  
- Supports multiple feature sets for improved accuracy  
- Provides clear visualization of attack patterns  

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Network traffic data is cleaned, normalized and labeled to distinguish normal and attack traffic.  
2. **Feature Selection:** Key features are selected to improve detection accuracy and reduce computational complexity.  
3. **Model Training:** Machine learning algorithms are trained on the labeled dataset.  
4. **Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix.
